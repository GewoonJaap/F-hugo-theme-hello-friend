# Forked Hello Friend Project

I use the [Hello Friend theme by @panr](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend) to display my personal development blog built with the Hugo static site generator. The main reason I've forked the source is to make various enhancements to the theme while keeping up-to-date with any changes made in the source. I often contribute to the theme by making pull requests for the enhancements I make, and it's great when they're happily received.

Just to be clear -- I set the default branch of this repo to my **Working** branch that I use on my own site. It contains some of the improvements that were successfully pulled back to the source along with a few others that didn't fit the base theme very well. The **Master** branch is in line with the original theme repo.

If you want to use this theme, I recommend cloning @panr's original repo. :slightly_smiling_face:

## Improvements Pulled to Theme Source

- Last Modified Date display on pages (based on a file's git commit info)
- Enable/disable comments section on individual pages
- Bug fix for some incorrect default Dates being displayed

## Other Local Improvements

- Enhanced RSS feed that displays cover image and provides options to display content summary or full text (Promising PR in progress)
- Position param (left, center, right) in the imgproc shortcode for image positioning
- Basic Table of Contents param (auto-generated)
